This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
data2009 <-read.csv("2009.Data.Entry.Copy.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
str(data2009)
data2018 <-read.csv("2018.Data.Entry.Copy.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",",stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
str(data2018)

```
pulled in both data sets of data from csv files 
```{r}
d18<-data2018$SiteName[data2018$SiteName=="Naimen"]<-"Naiman"

```
renamed the variable Naimen to Naiman to match 2009 data and created a new dataframe with manipulated data
```{r}
d09<-rename(data2009,Transect = SiteCode)
```
renamed sitecode to transect in 2009 data to match 2018 and created a new dataframe with manipulated 
```{r}
install.packages("reshape")
d09pc <- cast(d09,SiteName + PlotNumber ~ Species_Code, value='Cover', FUN=mean)

```
installed reshape package and casted data by species type and site code. Used cover as value to track basic presence/absence for 2009 data
```{r}
library(dplyr)
d18<-rename(data2018,Species_Code = SpeciesCode)
```
reloaded dplyr pakage, and renamed SpeciesCode to match d09 
```{r}
d18pc <- cast(d18,SiteName + PlotNumber ~ Species_Code, value='Cover', FUN=mean)
```
performed same cast function for d18 to obtain presence absence 
```{r}
library(dplyr)
d18<-rename(data2018,Species_Code = SpeciesCode)
d18pc <- cast(d18,SiteName + PlotNumber ~ Species_Code, value='Cover', FUN=mean)
```
load dplyr package, created new data frame for manipulation of data called d18. Casted d18 into d18pc for presence/absence. 
```{r}
statsd09<-group_by(d09,SiteName)
group_by(statsd09,Species_Code)
meancover <- summarise(statsd09, mean=Cover)
```
created new data frame to calculate summary stats for original dataframe copy. Grouped by SiteName then by Species. compute mean cover.
